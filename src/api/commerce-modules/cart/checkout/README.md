Step: Present available shipping methods based on the provided address and let the customer choose one.

**Why**: Shipping method selection determines delivery options and costs, which may affect the total order amount.

Step:

- Retrieve available payment providers for the cartâ€™s region.
- Let the customer select a payment provider.
- If needed, create a payment collection for the cart and initialize payment sessions.
- Collect any additional payment details (e.g., card info for Stripe) as required by the provider.

**Why**: Payment provider selection is essential for processing the transaction. Initializing the payment session ensures the provider is ready to authorize the payment when the order is placed.

Step:

- Perform any required actions with the payment provider (e.g., authorize payment).
- Call the Complete Cart API to finalize the order.

**Why**: This step authorizes the payment and creates the order in Medusa. If payment authorization fails or requires additional action, handle it before retrying.

Step:

- On successful cart completion, unset the cart (remove cart ID from storage).
- Redirect the customer to an order confirmation page.

**Why**: The cart is no longer valid after order placement. The confirmation page provides feedback and order details to the customer.

Step:

- The fulfillment process is typically triggered automatically after order creation.
- The merchant or automated system processes the order for shipping and delivery.

**Why**: Fulfillment ensures the purchased products are delivered to the customer. This step is handled by the merchant/admin and is not part of the customer-facing checkout flow, but is essential for completing the transaction lifecycle.

Emphasis on Order:

- Addresses and shipping must be set before payment because shipping costs and taxes may affect the total amount to be paid.
- Payment session must be initialized before completing the cart to ensure the payment provider is ready to process the transaction.
- Cart must be completed before fulfillment because fulfillment is based on a confirmed order.
